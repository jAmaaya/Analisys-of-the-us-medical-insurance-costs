# Project: Analysis of the US Medical Insurance Costs

## Project Goals

This project aims to perform data analysis on a given database using Python. The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Average Age:** Calculate and present the average age of individuals in the database.
2. **Average BMI by Age Groups:** Calculate and present the average BMI for different age groups: 18-25, 26-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61 and above.
3. **Children by Age Groups:** Calculate and present the count of children for each age group: 18-25, 26-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61 and above.
4. **Regions with More Smokers:** Determine which region (Southwest, Southeast, Northwest, Northeast) has the highest number of smokers.
5. **Average Costs:** Calculate and present the average medical costs across the entire database.
6. **Average Costs by Gender:** Calculate and present the average medical costs separately for men and women.
7. **Gender Distribution:** Calculate and present the count of women and men in the database.

## Instructions

1. **Database Variable:** Create a variable that represents the database containing the required data for analysis.

2. **Code Implementation:** The Python code should implement the analysis tasks as outlined in the project goals.

3. **Results:** Display the results of each analysis using appropriate print statements or visualizations.
